# Vulnerability Scanner for DVWA

This Python-based vulnerability scanner is designed to test for common web vulnerabilities in the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). It automates the process of crawling through web pages, identifying forms, and testing for vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, command injection, CSRF, and file inclusion.

## Features

- **XSS Detection**: Identifies Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in forms and URLs.
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Tests for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in forms and URLs.
- **Command Injection Detection**: Checks for Command Injection vulnerabilities in URLs.
- **CSRF Detection**: Identifies forms that lack Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens.
- **File Inclusion Detection**: Tests for Local and Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lakshminarayan-p/vulnerability_scanner.git
   cd vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 2.7 is installed along with the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests BeautifulSoup
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Update the `target_url` and `links_to_ignore` variables in `scanner.py` and `vulnerability_scanner.py` to match your DVWA instance URL and any URLs you want to ignore (e.g., logout links).

4. **Run the Scanner**:
   Execute `vulnerability_scanner.py` to start scanning:
   ```bash
   python vulnerability_scanner.py
   ```

   This script will log into DVWA, crawl all accessible links, and test for vulnerabilities as configured.

## Usage

- **Customization**: Modify the scanner to add additional vulnerability tests or customize existing ones.
- **Logging**: Monitor console output for vulnerability alerts and investigate reported issues.

## Example Output

Upon running the scanner, you will see output similar to:

```
